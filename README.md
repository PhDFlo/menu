# Restaurant Menu

This project is a simple restaurant menu web application that displays a list of menu items organized into sections. It is designed to be clean and user-friendly, making it easy for customers to view the offerings of the restaurant.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `css/style.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the restaurant menu, including styles for the body, menu container, headings, menu sections, and menu items.
- `index.html`: The main HTML document that structures the menu and links to the `style.css` file for styling.
- `README.md`: This documentation file provides an overview of the project and instructions for use.

## Usage

To view the restaurant menu, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The menu will be displayed with the applied styles from the `style.css` file.

## Customization

You can customize the menu items and styles by editing the `index.html` and `css/style.css` files respectively. Add or modify menu sections and items as needed to fit your restaurant's offerings.
